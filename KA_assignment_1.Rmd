# Assignment 1: Mapping the spatial distribution of greenspace with median house prices, London. 

## Overview
The maps visualise the distribution of green spaces in London, and their relationship to house prices. Studies have shown green spaces are beneficial for physical and mental health (Mitchell and Popham, 2007, Irvine et al, 2010, WHO 2016), so we question their quantifiable value, and their equitable distribution. 
The greenspaces dataset consists of spatial, nominal data. Median house price data (2014) is imported as a dataframe (CSV) which was joined to Ward boundaries to create a choropleth. A transport layer was added for context, to understand areas that are well connected which might explain higher house prices.
A grayscale choropleth palette was selected to create a visual contrast between the dataset and the other layers. A green scale palette was used to conform to traditional convention, yet to distinguish between the nominal attributes.

## ArcGIS - A GUI-based software.
A geodatabase was set up to store feature classes, creating an accessible DBMS. Spatial datasets were imported as shapefiles before exportation to feature classes, mitigating issues with shapefiles and storing attributes. Projections were British National Grid; no re-projections were necessary. 
Whilst spatial data layers are easily added, there are requirements for ArcGIS to read csv files. A drawback of ArcGIS is the manual data cleaning process prior to importing csv’s.
Jenks breaks were employed for defining colour breaks. A limitation of natural break algorithms is their tendency to miss obvious cut-off points (Monmonier, 2005), or comparison figures such as the London-wide median.

The select-by-location tool selects the greenspaces intersecting London boundaries. 
The layout feature is used to export the map. Due to the map’s static nature, a central part of London has been displayed, with Greater London displayed for context adjacent.

ArcGIS provides a more visual way of mapping, with an intuitive layer structure. Levels of uncertainty are easily evaluated, noting the impact of selecting ward data as opposed to borough data.

##	R – code based software
Importing data was efficient: csv’s didn’t require prior formatting, creating a better workflow for processing large datasets. 

```{r}
#read some data attributes
LondonData <- read_csv("Ward profile/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv", na = "n/a")

WardBoundaries <- read_shape("Wards/London_Ward_CityMerged.shp", as.sf = TRUE)

OS_greenspaces <- read_shape("Greenspaces/OS_LDN_greenspaces.shp", as.sf = TRUE)

os_transport <- read_shape("Transport/gis_osm_railways_free_1.shp", as.sf = TRUE)


```



A sf object was created from joining the house price data to the ward boundary shapefile, before employing the library tmaps to create the plots. 

```{r}
#convert to a simple features object
LondonMapSF <- st_as_sf(WardBoundaries)
#append the data to the geometries
LondonMapSF <- append_data(LondonMapSF,LondonData, key.shp = "GSS_CODE", key.data = "New code", ignore.duplicates = TRUE)

```

```{r projections}
#set the projections to BNG using ESPG code for British National Grid
LondonMapSFBNG <- st_transform(LondonMapSF,27700)
OS_greenspacesBNG <- st_transform(OS_greenspaces,27700)
OS_transportBNG <- st_transform(os_transport,27700)
```

```{r}
# add basemap if needed - not included currently as choropleth isn't visible
london_osm <- read_osm(LondonMapSF, type = "osm", zoom = NULL)

# The CRS for the layers were verified above before proceeding to plot the map. The colour palette chosen (color brewer) and Jenks breaks were specified. 

# change tmap mode to "view" is recommend for viewing the data, but as a PDF document is required it is set to plot.

tmap_mode("view")
  tm_shape(OS_greenspacesBNG)+
   tm_polygons(col = "function.",palette="Greens")+
   tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE) +
  tm_shape(OS_transportBNG)+
   tm_lines(col = "fclass",palette="PuRd") +
   tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE)+
  tm_shape(LondonMapSFBNG)+
   tm_polygons("Median House Price - 2014", 
        style="jenks",
        palette="Greys",
        midpoint=NA,
        title="Median House Price - 2014",
        alpha = 0.5) #+
 # tm_compass(position = c("left", "bottom"),type = "arrow") + 
#  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom")) +
#  tm_layout(title = "Median House Price - 2014", legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
  
```

Creating interactive maps was beneficial; interactive scaling allows exploratory viewing of detailed datsets and mitigates biases of representation. If the viewer could determine the colour breaks, this would further avoid bias of representation. 

## Reflections

The house price dataset could be more robust by controlling for the housing types by ward. Due to the small scale of many greenspaces, ward-level data may be too aggregated to visualise any relationship.
The functions of green spaces in the OS dataset are too detailed for the map’s purpose; the categories could be further aggregated to be graphically clearer. 

Ward data was selected as the smallest boundary available for the house price dataset, but as an authoritative boundary it is prone to MAUP effects and ecological fallacies. Analysing disaggregated data is possible, but in practical terms data would be difficult to obtain due to processes of data collection and anonymization (D.Sui, 2009).

## Implications

These maps explore the equitability and value of London’s green spaces by its association with a quantifiable value (house prices), but further analysis is required to determine a relationship. Considering the evidenced health benefit of green spaces, these maps could convey and inform policies, supporting the equitable distribution of green spaces and monitoring their effect over time.
