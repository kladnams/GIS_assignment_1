# Assignment 1: Mapping the spatial distribution of greenspace with median house prices, London. 

## Key aims and data sources 
The two maps produced for this assignment explore the spatial distribution of green spaces in Greater London, and their relationship to house prices. The primary objective is to understand the extent (if any) to which green space affects house prices. Studies have increasingly shown green spaces to be beneficial for physical and mental health (Mitchell and Popham, 2007, Irvine et al, 2010, WHO 2016), so we can further question whether they have a quantifiable value, and whether they equitably distributed within London. Including transport connections in the map controled for areas which might be more desirable because of their connectivity, and provides some visual reference points of major transport hubs. 

The greenspaces dataset is sourced from Ordinance Survey. Mapping greenspaces in urban areas, it endeavors to support a wider set of government initiatives around health and the environment (ref). The nominal data is mapped below, conveying the function of each space.

London median house price data (2014) was taken from the London Ward atlas dataset. Median values to mitigate the effect of any significant outliers, however a measure that controls for the proportion of different property types (i.e. flats or houses) would improve the quality of the map and any subsequent analysis.

## Workflows & Cartography 
### ArcGIS - A GUI-based software.
Setting up a geodatabase to store feature classes was an intuitive process and results in an easily accessible, editable and managed DBMS. The spatial datasets were imported initially as shapefiles before being exported as feature classes, to mitigate inherent issues with shapefiles and storing attributes to spatial information. Properties of the feature classes were verified to be British National Grid, no re-projections were necessary in this case. 
Whilst spatial data layers are easily added, there are stringent requirements for ArcGIS to read csv files. This entails a more manual data cleaning process prior to importing the file, which is a considerable drawback for any large datasets required. 
The house price data was imported as a CSV file, and then joined to a ward boundary shapefile to create a choropleth map. For defining appropriate colour breaks, the dataset distribution was reviewed and Jenks breaks were employed.

A limitation of natural break algorithms is their tendency to miss obvious cut-off points (Monmonier, 2005), or comparison figures such as the London-wide median. For transparency, the variance and cut-off points the histogram can be plotted alongside the map and the London wide median noted.

A grayscale colour palette was selected to create a visual contrast between the dataset and the greenspaces and transport link spatial layers. 

To create the greenspace dataset for Greater London only, the select by location tool was used and exported to a feature class. As the geographical dataset is difficult to understand as a whole due to ranges in scale, statistics on the overall number of each type of greenspace in greater London can be added to the legend to provide a level of contextual information. Another key distinguishing feature between the greenspace categories is their area, so a bubble diagram is employed to provide information on their average size. A green scale palette was used to conform to traditional convention, yet to distinguish between the nominal attributes.

Finally, a transport layer was added to provide context, to understand i) areas that are well connected which might explain higher house prices and ii) wards with main interchanges that may be less residential than other wards. It would be useful to include what proportion of a ward is residential to understand the sample sizes the house price data is taken from.

The layout feature of ArcGIS provides a useful tool for exporting map, through dataframes allowing different scale displays and different layers of information. Due to the map’s static nature and high level of information, a central part of London has been displayed, with the entirety of Greater London displayed for context in a smaller scale adjacent. 
A GUI provides an iterative and visual way to build maps, as it is easy to review the structure and hierarchy of layers in use. This made levels of uncertainty quick to review and evaluate, in this case noting the statistical and visual impact of selecting ward data as opposed to borough data.

## R - Code based software 
The same map is generated through R, to evaluate the differences in process and output. The process of importing data was efficient: the cleaning of csv file data is automated which created a better workflow for processing the data. R read in different dataset types directly from the internet as well as locally. R seems a more powerful tool for processing large datasets than GUI software such as ArcGIS.  For this particular map, the same shapefiles were used as for the first map.
The CRS for the layers were verified before proceed to plot the map.
```{r}
# pro4 string print
```
Simple plots were produced to check the distribution of data, similar to the process for ArcGIS.
```{r}
# plot histogram
```
A simple features object from joining the house price data to the ward boundary shapefile, before employing the library tmaps to create the plots. The colour palette chosen was similar to that of ArcGIS, although ColorBrewer was used, which includes an extensive colour library based on academic research. Jenks natural breaks were specified in the code to classify the colour breaks. 
```{r}
# jenks and plot static map
```

In addition the OS basemap was added, and proved useful for viewing the wider context of the map. 
Using tmaps to view data interactively at multiple scales was beneficial for the data, which wasn’t possible in Arcmap. As the datasets (the OS greenspace layer in particular) are highly detailed, interactive scaling and allowing the user to view layers individually allows more exploratory insight and mitigates any bias of representation. If the viewer could determine cut-off points for the choropleth map, this would further avoid bias of representation. 

```{r}
# code for plotting interactive map
```

A drawback of R is low level of graphical control over the legend content and overall design compared to GUI systems, which may require more expertise. R seems to be a powerful way of analyzing and processing vast datasets, however the process of building maps is less visually driven and intuitive. 

# Limitations

### The datasets
The house price dataset could be more robust by controlling for the type of housing in each ward. A measure such as ‘median value for a 2 bed flat’ would be more beneficial as housing stock varies largely at a London-wide scale. 
Due to the small scale of many parks in an urban centre such as London, ward-level data may be too aggregated to determine a relationship.
The functions of green spaces in the OS dataset are perhaps too detailed for the map’s purpose; the categories could be further aggregated to be graphically clearer. 

### Uncertainty 
Administrative boundaries are liable to change over time, which can skew results. In using ward level data, areas changed in 2014 which caused issues when importing data from various online sources. 
Ward level data was selected as the smallest boundary available for the house price dataset, but as it is an authoritative boundary it is not necessarily reliable and prone to MAUP and ecological fallacies. 
Ward and borough level data is compared below, which show boroughs as quite heterogenous. Disaggregated data is sometimes possible to improve studies, but in practical terms such data would be difficult to obtain in practical terms due to processes of data collection and anonymization (D.Sui, 2009).

## Implications 
These maps are exploratory in nature and do not draw a conclusion without further analysis; there does not seem to be any immediate visual correlation between the datasets. The maps explore the equitability of green space and value of green space in London by its association with a quantifiable value (house prices). As there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that green spaces have public health benefits, such maps have the power to inform policies and support the equitable distribution of green spaces, understanding and monitoring their effect over time.
